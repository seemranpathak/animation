This project involved the creation of a motion graphics/animation website using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the HTML5 Canvas.  
HTML provided the structure and content of the website, while CSS was responsible for the styling and layout, including animations and transitions for user interface elements.  
The core logic for the animations, user interactions, and canvas manipulation was implemented using JavaScript.  
The HTML5 Canvas was the primary tool for drawing and animating graphics, creating visual effects, and rendering the motion sequences.
